# Settings and Config for VisualStudio

## StevenHarman-Bengal.vssettings

Fonts & Colors I used, based loosely on RobConery's VS VibrantInk.

## StevenHarman-OtherStuff.vssettings

This file contains non-font/color settings (stuff like key-mappings, tabs/spaces, etc.):

		General Settings
			Window Layouts
		Options
			Environment
				Keyboard
			TextEditor

The Keyboard Shortcuts are based off of the default Resharper 2.5 and IntelliJ IDEA settings. I've added/changed several shortcuts to lower the friction even further.

### Much of this originated from [Code Incubator](codeincubator.com), but has moved here since I gave up on SVN and moved to Git and [The GitHubs](http://github.com/stevenharman).
